 * Booking Verification: verify TBO's actual booking outcome via GetBookingDetail.
 *
 * TBO Recommendation:
 * "If booking processing time exceeds 120 seconds cutoff, call BookingDetail
 *  using BookingId to know final status and avoid financial loss."
 *
 * TBO Certification requirement ("Not calling in failed booking case"): this
 * must also be called when Book reported an explicit failure (BookFailed),
 * whenever TBO gave us an identifier (BookingId/TraceId) to look up — not
 * only for timeouts/ambiguous outcomes. A BookFailed response does not
 * guarantee TBO didn't create a booking record.
 *
 * This function attempts to retrieve booking status when the initial booking
 * request timed out, returned ambiguous/unknown outcome, or explicitly
 * failed. It can query by:
 * - bookingId: If returned in the Book response
 * - confirmationNo: If confirmation was issued despite timeout
 * - traceId: Fallback identifier from the Book response
